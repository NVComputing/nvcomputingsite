				<p>At Computing Team, we do a variety of activities, mostly revolving around programming and computer science topics.</p>
				<p><i>(To join the club, it is recommended that you either have taken or are taking AP Computer Science A, otherwise you may have trouble understanding the material.)</i></p>
				<p>In our meetings, we cover many computer science topics, practice solving programming problems, and do fun programming competitions. Most of the activity we do is to practice and prepare for two major contests:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>American Computer Science League (ACSL)</li>
					<li>USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>ACSL is a computer science competition that involves short answer and programming problems and a wide variety of computer science related short answer topics. <a href="/resources/acsl/">Further details and resources for ACSL.</a></p>
				<p>USACO is a multistage programming competition that progressively gets more difficult as you rank up. In USACO, you solve 3 highly difficult programming problems in a set amount of time. There are 4 levels at which people participate, going up in difficulty from Bronze to Platinum. <a href="/resources/usaco/">Further details and resources for USACO.</a></p>
				<p>Along with preparing for these contests, we also often do mock Codeforces contests as practice. <a href="https://codeforces.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codeforces</a> is a website in which you solve multiple programming problems online within a set time frame. We will be hosting multiple practice contests in which you can compete with everyone else in the club throughout the year.</p>
				<p>If any of these activities sound interesting to you, you should definitely join Computing Team.</p>

						<h5>Q: Am I good enough to join?</h5>
						<div class="font-weight-light">Yes. Having some computer science knowledge is preferred, but if you are willing to put in the effort to learn, you should join anyway.</div>
