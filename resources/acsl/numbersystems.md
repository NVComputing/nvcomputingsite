# Converting between Bases

There are many tricks that can be used to convert between bases. However, this is a simple all use strategy to convert from any base to base 10 and to base 10 from any base.

Any base to base 10:

- Suppose there is a number D with N digits in base K.
  - This would be written D<sub>n</sub> D<sub>n-1</sub> D<sub>n-2</sub> ... D<sub>3</sub> D<sub>2</sub> D<sub>1</sub>
- To calculate the value in base 10, it is as simple as taking the same of every digit D<sub>a</sub> and multiplying it by k<sup>a-1</sup>.
  - This would be formally written as \sum_{i=1}^{10} (D<sub>i</sub>* k<sup>i-1</sup>).
