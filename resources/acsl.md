# Introduction

Formally known as the American Computer Science League, ACSL is a computer science competition consisting of 4 contests and a final All-Star contest (if our cumulative scores are high enough).
There are 5 different levels of difficulty, although this team will focus on the Intermediate and Senior levels.

## Basics

ACSL is a contest that focuses on around a dozen different concepts of computer science.
While many of these concepts are more abstract in nature, ACSL also provides concrete programming problems.

## Contest Format

There will always be 2 parts to any contest: short answer and programming. For the short answer section,
you will have 30 minutes to answer 5 questions; we do this during some of our meetings. As for the programming section, you will have 3 days to complete one program (in any programming language you want) at home. The short answer and programming sections both contribute 5 points each, thus making the highest score you can get for any given contest a 10.

For the All-Star contest, there are still 2 parts to it. However, for the programming section, you work with a team for 4 hours on a multitude of programs. As for the short answer portion, you will have 1 hour to do 12 questions instead; you will have to be proficient in all of the categories tested in the regular contests. Prizes are given to the highest-scoring teams and individuals.

# Programming

ACSL's programming questions are often very brute-forcey and vaguely defined in nature. Here are some tips
to answering them.

If you have trouble with programming in general, don't worry! Each week, we will provide a
programming question so that you can improve your skills. We will also hold CodeForces "contests"
within our team.

## What to Keep In Mind

- Don't forget the [general tips](/resources/tips) that apply to all code you write. Also, make sure your code [is efficient](/resources/efficiency).
- MAKE SURE to include a header at the top of your submitted code. The header should look like this:
```java
/*
 * Name: Raymond Zhao
 * School: Neuqua Valley High School
 * Division: Senior
 * Grade: 12
 * Problem: Some Arbitrary Proprietary Board Game ACSL Randomly Decided To Come Up With
 */
```
- Oftentimes, ACSL's problems (more often in programming than short answer) are vague and confusing. Sometimes, you might find yourself
needing to deduce the exact function of the program from the sample test cases. In this case, just try to figure the problem out.
