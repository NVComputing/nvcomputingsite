[Link to Submission Form](https://forms.gle/g2q6DRWVhpuEQWvn8)

## Directions

Answer the following problems, and submit your answers to the Google form linked below. Please don’t waste your time by cheating, unless you plan to do so during the actual contest as well.

- Calculators

- Friends

## Problem 1
Given the mathematical function below, find the value of `$f(1600)$`.

### `$\begin{equation*}f(x) = \begin{cases}f(x+3)-1 &\text{if $x \leq 25$}\\4x &\text{if $25 < x < 40$}\\f(x/4)+12 &\text{if $x \geq 40$}\end{cases}\end{equation*}$`

Express your answer as an integer.
    
## Problem 2
Given that `$f(21)=13$`, find `$c$` in the mathematical function below:

### `$\begin{equation*}f(x) = \begin{cases}f(x+3)-12 &\text{if $x \leq 10$}\\x-c &\text{if $10 < x < 15$}\\f(x-6)+4 &\text{if $x \geq 15$}\end{cases}\end{equation*}$`

Express your answer as an integer.

## Problem 3
Given the mathematical function below, find the value of `$f(32, 14)$`.

Note: `$\left \lfloor{x}\right \rfloor$` is the mathematical "floor" function, which asks you to round down to the nearest integer (for example, `$\left \lfloor{5.76}\right \rfloor = 5$`)

### `$\begin{equation*}f(x, y) = \begin{cases}x y &\text{if $x \leq y$}\\f(3 \left \lfloor{\sqrt{x}}\right \rfloor, y + 1) &\text{if $x > y$}\end{cases}\end{equation*}$`

Express your answer as an integer.

## Problem 4
Given the mathematical function below, find `$f(32)$`:

### `$\begin{equation*}f(x) = \begin{cases}2x &\text{if $x < 10$}\\f(x-1)+1 &\text{if $10 \leq x < 15$}\\f(x-4)+4 &\text{if $x \geq 15$}\end{cases}\end{equation*}$`

Express your answer as an integer.

## Note

The remaining questions are challenge questions. This means they are OPTIONAL. (They might curry you a bit of favor with the captains, though.)

## Challenge Question 1
Given the mathematical function below, find `$f(15,18)$`.

### `$\begin{equation*}f(x,y) = \begin{cases}f(x+1,y-2)+f(y,x)+1 &\text{if $x < y$}\\f(f(\frac{x}{2},y),\frac{x}{2})-3 &\text{if $x = y$}\\x-y &\text{if $x > y$}\end{cases}\end{equation*}$`

Express your answer as an integer.

## Challenge Question 2
Given the mathematical function below, find `$f(20,15)$`.

### `$\begin{equation*}f(x,y) = \begin{cases}1 &\text{if $x + y = 2$}\\xy \bullet f(x-1, y) &\text{if $y = 1$ and $x > 1$}\\\frac{f(x,1)}{f(y,1) \bullet f(x-y, 1)} &\text{if $y > 1$}\end{cases}\end{equation*}$`

Express your answer as an integer.

## Practice Programming Problem
For this week, there is one problem:

[Factorial](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/64/A)

Solve this problem and submit your answer to Codeforces (contact the captains if you have any issues with Codeforces).

### Submission Instructions

Click the link and solve the problem in your IDE and language of choice. After you finish the problem, submit your code.
The submit button is in the top left (next to Problems).

As proof of your submission, provide us a screenshot that looks somewhat like the following:

(Header columns are not required - just the data underneath the headers. Any screenshot is fine, as long as it shows
the necessary data - it can be of your whole screen.)

(We won't check your code - just your submission.)
