- Friends

## Problem 1
Convert the following into binary: `$(32F9E)_{16}$`

(Express your answer in binary form. Omit the base 2. Also, don't forget to )

## Problem 2
Which of the following has the most `0`s in its binary representation?

<ol type="a">
  <li><code>$492_{10}$</code></li>
  <li><code>$10101100101_{2}$</code></li>
  <li><code>$BC52_{16}$</code></li>

</ol>

## Problem 3
What is `$100101011_{2} + 111323_{4}$`?

(Express your answer in base 4.)

## Problem 4
Convert the following into base `10`:

`$100.101_{2}$`

## Problem 5
Solve for `$X$`.

`$37_{9}+122_{5}*X_{6}=984_{11}$`

(Header columns are not required - just the data underneath the headers. Any screenshot is fine, as long as it shows
the necessary data - it can be of your whole screen.)

(We won't check your code - just your submission.)
